                How the conditions list should be combined to determine if a request
                is granted this AccessLevel. If AND is used, each Condition in
                conditions must be satisfied for the AccessLevel to be applied. If

                official release (which is not necessarily the latest version).  Most users will find
                the google_container_engine_versions data source useful - it indicates which versions
                are available, and can be use to approximate fuzzy versions in a
                Terraform-compatible way. If you intend to specify versions manually,
                the docs
                describe the various acceptable formats for this field.

                - (Optional) Determines whether alias IPs or routes will be used for pod IPs in the cluster.
                Options are VPC_NATIVE or ROUTES. VPC_NATIVE enables IP aliasing,
                and requires the ip_allocation_policy block to be defined. By default, when this field is unspecified and no ip_allocation_policy blocks are set, GKE will create a ROUTES-based cluster.
            node_config: |-
                -  (Optional) Parameters used in creating the default node pool.
                Generally, this field should not be used at the same time as a
                google_container_node_pool or a node_pool block; this configuration
                manages the default node pool, which isn't recommended to be used with

                - (Optional) Parameters for the Google Container Filesystem (GCFS).
                If unspecified, GCFS will not be enabled on the node pool. When enabling this feature you must specify image_type = "COS_CONTAINERD" and node_version from GKE versions 1.19 or later to use it.
                For GKE versions 1.19, 1.20, and 1.21, the recommended minimum node_version would be 1.19.15-gke.1300, 1.20.11-gke.1300, and 1.21.5-gke.1300 respectively.
                A machine_type that has more than 16 GiB of memory is also recommended.
                GCFS must be enabled in order to use image streaming.

            node_config.guest_accelerator: |-
                - (Optional) List of the type and count of accelerator cards attached to the instance.
                Structure documented below.
                To support removal of guest_accelerators in Terraform 0.12 this field is an
                Attribute as Block
            node_config.gvnic: |-
                - (Optional) Google Virtual NIC (gVNIC) is a virtual network interface.
                Installing the gVNIC driver allows for more efficient traffic transmission across the Google network infrastructure.
                gVNIC is an alternative to the virtIO-based ethernet driver. GKE nodes must use a Container-Optimized OS node image.

                - (Optional) The name of a Google Compute Engine machine type.
                Defaults to e2-medium. To create a custom machine type, value should be set as specified
                here.
            node_config.metadata: |-
                - (Optional) The metadata key/value pairs assigned to instances in
                the cluster. From GKE 1.12 onwards, disable-legacy-endpoints is set to
                true by the API; if metadata is set but that default value is not
                included, Terraform will attempt to unset the value. To avoid this, set the
                value in your config.
            node_config.min_cpu_platform: |-
                - (Optional) Minimum CPU platform to be used by this instance.
                The instance may be scheduled on the specified or newer CPU platform. Applicable
                values are the friendly names of CPU platforms, such as Intel Haswell. See the
                official documentation
                for more information.
            node_config.node_group: '- (Optional) Setting this field will assign instances of this pool to run on the specified node group. This is useful for running workloads on sole tenant nodes.'

                on all of the node VMs under the "default" service account.
                Use the "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform" scope to grant access to all APIs. It is recommended that you set service_account to a non-default service account and grant IAM roles to that service account for only the resources that it needs.
            node_config.preemptible: |-
                - (Optional) A boolean that represents whether or not the underlying node VMs
                are preemptible. See the official documentation
                for more information. Defaults to false.
            node_config.sandbox_config: |-
                - (Optional, Beta) GKE Sandbox configuration. When enabling this feature you must specify image_type = "COS_CONTAINERD" and node_version = "1.12.7-gke.17" or later to use it.
                Structure is documented below.
            node_config.service_account: |-
                - (Optional) The service account to be used by the Node VMs.
                If not specified, the "default" service account is used.

            node_config.tags: |-
                - (Optional) The list of instance tags applied to all nodes. Tags are used to identify
                valid sources or targets for network firewalls.
            node_config.taint: |-
                - (Optional) A list of Kubernetes taints
                to apply to nodes. GKE's API can only set this field on cluster creation.
                However, GKE will add taints to your nodes if you enable certain features such
                as GPUs. If this field is set, any diffs on this field will cause Terraform to
                recreate the underlying resource. Taint values can be updated safely in
                Kubernetes (eg. through kubectl), and it's recommended that you do not use
                this field to manage taints. If you do, lifecycle.ignore_changes is
                recommended. Structure is documented below.
            node_config.workload_metadata_config: |-
                - (Optional) Metadata configuration to expose to workloads on the node pool.
                Structure is documented below.
            node_locations: |-
                - (Optional) The list of zones in which the cluster's nodes
                are located. Nodes must be in the region of their regional cluster or in the
                same region as their cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If this is specified for
                a zonal cluster, omit the cluster's zone.
            node_pool: |-
                - (Optional) List of node pools associated with this cluster.
                See google_container_node_pool for schema.
                Warning: node pools defined inside a cluster can't be changed (or added/removed) after
                cluster creation without deleting and recreating the entire cluster. Unless you absolutely need the ability
                to say "these are the only node pools associated with this cluster", use the
                google_container_node_pool resource instead of this property.
            node_version: |-
                - (Optional) The Kubernetes version on the nodes. Must either be unset
                or set to the same value as min_master_version on create. Defaults to the default
                version set by GKE which is not necessarily the latest version. This only affects
                nodes in the default node pool. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
                recommended that you specify explicit versions as Terraform will see spurious diffs
                when fuzzy versions are used. See the google_container_engine_versions data source's
                version_prefix field to approximate fuzzy versions in a Terraform-compatible way.
                To update nodes in other node pools, use the version attribute on the node pool.

                (Optional) - When true, the cluster's private
                endpoint is used as the cluster endpoint and access through the public endpoint
                is disabled. When false, either endpoint can be used. This field only applies
                to private clusters, when enable_private_nodes is true.
            private_cluster_config.enable_private_nodes: |-
                (Optional) - Enables the private cluster feature,
                creating a private endpoint on the cluster. In a private cluster, nodes only
                have RFC 1918 private addresses and communicate with the master's private
                endpoint via private networking.
            private_cluster_config.master_global_access_config: |-
                (Optional) - Controls cluster master global
                access settings. If unset, Terraform will no longer manage this field and will
                not modify the previously-set value. Structure is documented below.
            private_cluster_config.master_global_access_config.enabled: |-
                (Optional) - Whether the cluster master is accessible globally or
                not.
            private_cluster_config.master_ipv4_cidr_block: |-
                (Optional) - The IP range in CIDR notation to use for
                the hosted master network. This range will be used for assigning private IP
                addresses to the cluster master(s) and the ILB VIP. This range must not overlap
                with any other ranges in use within the cluster's network, and it must be a /28
                subnet. See Private Cluster Limitations
                for more details. This field only applies to private clusters, when
                enable_private_nodes is true.
            private_cluster_config.peering_name: '- The name of the peering between this cluster and the Google owned VPC.'
            private_cluster_config.private_endpoint: '- The internal IP address of this cluster''s master endpoint.'
            private_cluster_config.public_endpoint: '- The external IP address of this cluster''s master endpoint.'
            private_ipv6_google_access: |-
                - (Optional)
                The desired state of IPv6 connectivity to Google Services. By default, no private IPv6 access to or from Google Services (all access will be via IPv4).

                feature, which provide more control over automatic upgrades of your GKE clusters.
                When updating this field, GKE imposes specific version requirements. See
                Selecting a new release channel
                for more details; the google_container_engine_versions datasource can provide
                the default version for a channel. Note that removing the release_channel
                field from your config will cause Terraform to stop managing your cluster's
                release channel, but will not unenroll it. Instead, use the "UNSPECIFIED"
                channel. Structure is documented below.
            release_channel.channel: |-
                - (Required) The selected release channel.

                (Optional) - Whether to enable resource
                consumption metering on this cluster. When enabled, a table will be created in
                the resource export BigQuery dataset to store resource consumption data. The
                resulting table can be joined with the resource usage table or with BigQuery
                billing export. Defaults to true.
            sandbox_config.sandbox_type: |-
                (Required) Which sandbox to use for pods in the node pool.
                Accepted values are:
